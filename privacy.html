      <h2>1. Who we are (data controller)</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and process personal data when you
        visit our website
        <strong>bluedolphinbeachhome.com</strong>, join our pre-launch mailing list
        or otherwise interact with us online.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
        (<strong>GDPR</strong>), the data controller is:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Blue Dolphin Beach Home</strong><br />
        Owner / Representative: <strong>BlueDolphinBeachHome</strong><br />
        Registered / postal address: <strong>PO Box 196, Mebane NC 27302</strong><br />
        Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@bluedolphinbeachhome.com">privacy@bluedolphinbeachhome.com</a><br />
        </p>
      <p class="small">
        If you stay with us in Sardinia, we may also process personal data offline
        (e.g. to comply with local guest registration and tax rules). This notice
        focuses on our <strong>website and email marketing</strong>; local
        check-in forms and contracts may provide additional information where needed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. What this Privacy Policy covers</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visitors to our website and landing pages;</li>
        <li>People who sign up to our newsletter or pre-launch VIP list;</li>
        <li>People who contact us via email or web forms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It does <strong>not</strong> apply to external websites, booking platforms
        or social networks that we may link to. Those services are governed by their
        own privacy policies.

      <h2>3. Personal data we collect</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Data you provide directly</h3>
      <p>When you interact with us, you may provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact details</strong> – such as first name, last name, email
          address, country of residence and language preference;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Booking-related information</strong> – such as desired dates of stay,
          number of guests, special requests or preferences, if you choose to share
          these in your message;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Marketing preferences</strong> – for example, whether you wish to
          receive emails about launches, special offers or Sardinia travel tips;
        </li>
        <li>
          Any other information you decide to include in a free-text message.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Data collected automatically</h3>
      <p>
        When you visit our website, certain technical information is collected
        automatically by our hosting and analytics tools, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address and approximate location (country / region);</li>
        <li>Device type, operating system and browser type;</li>
        <li>Pages visited, time and date of visit, time spent on each page;</li>
        <li>Referring website or campaign (e.g. if you clicked from a social post).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use privacy-friendly analytics (for example, a tool such as Plausible or
        a similar service) that does not build marketing profiles or sell data to
        third parties. Where possible, data is anonymised or aggregated.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Purposes and legal bases for processing</h2>

          <strong>Legal basis:</strong> the processing is necessary for

        <li>
          <strong>Legal basis:</strong> our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in

    <section>
      <h2>5. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Our website currently uses only a limited set of cookies and similar
        technologies, primarily for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Essential functionality</strong> (for example, remembering your
          language selection);
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy-friendly analytics</strong> to understand which pages are
          visited, without tracking individual users across the web.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we introduce additional cookies (for example, for marketing, remarketing
        or embedded services), we will update this policy and, where required,
        ask for your prior consent via a cookie banner.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Email marketing and Brevo</h2>
      <p>
        We use <strong>Brevo</strong> a European email and
        marketing automation platform, to manage our mailing lists and send emails to
        subscribers. Brevo acts as our <strong>data processor</strong> under GDPR,
        and processes your data only on our documented instructions. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
      </p>
      <p>When you join our list, your data is stored in Brevo and may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email address;</li>
        <li>First name and last name (if provided);</li>
        <li>Preferred language (e.g. EN / IT / DE / FR);</li>
        <li>
          Technical information about email delivery and interaction, such as opens
          or link clicks. We use these metrics to understand engagement and improve
          our content, not to make automated decisions about you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can unsubscribe from our emails at any time by clicking the
        <strong>“unsubscribe”</strong> link included in every message, or by
        contacting us directly.

    <section>
      <h2>7. Recipients and international transfers</h2>

      <h3>7.1 Service providers (data processors)</h3>
      <p>
        We share personal data with trusted service providers who help us operate
        our website and communications, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Website hosting and infrastructure services (e.g. a cloud hosting provider);
        </li>
        <li>
          Email and marketing automation (Brevo / Sendinblue);
        </li>
        <li>
          Privacy-friendly analytics provider;
        </li>
        <li>
          Professional advisers (such as accountants or lawyers) where necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These providers process your data only as necessary to provide their
        services, under contracts that include appropriate data protection clauses.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 Transfers outside the European Economic Area (EEA)</h3>
      <p>
        Our hosting and main mailing provider are located in the EU or EEA where
        possible. However, some tools or backups may involve transfers of personal
        data to countries outside the EEA (for example, if we access accounts from
        the United States).
      </p>
      <p>
        In such cases, we rely on appropriate safeguards under GDPR – such as
        <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong> adopted by the European
        Commission – or ensure that an adequacy decision is in place for the
        destination country.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>8. How long we keep your data</h2>
      <p>We keep personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes described above:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Newsletter / VIP list data:</strong> until you withdraw your
          consent by unsubscribing, plus a short additional period to record that
          you no longer wish to receive emails and to handle any legal claims.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enquiries by email or form:</strong> typically for up to
          <strong>24 months</strong> after our last interaction, unless a longer
          period is required by law (for example, accounting records).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical logs and security-related data:</strong> generally for
          a few months unless we need to retain them longer to investigate an
          incident or satisfy a legal requirement.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When data is no longer needed, we delete it or anonymise it so that it can
        no longer be linked to an identifiable person.
      </p>

        law. More information is available from your local data protection
